# Doppelgänger

View `themes-format.md` for a reference to the Doppelgänger theme format.

Sample nav bar logo images can be found in `images/nav/`. If you wish to use these, upload them to web space under your control and reference them as a URL in `navbar_logo_image`. These should be 450px x 120px.

Note: There is a known bug in build 1341 wherein custom logo images may be displayed incorrectly (shifted to the left) in some cases.
